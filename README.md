# One Rep Max app

The goal of this app is to import historical workout data and calculate the theoretical one-rep max for each exercise.

It will also provide a handy way of checking the evolution of those one-rep max values over time.

## Usage

The app implements file handling for plain text files, so importing data will be as easy as opening a text file (with the right format) with the app.

When using the simulator, draggin' and droppin' the file to it will have that same effect.

For simplicity, and given that it wasn't specified differently in the requirements, importing the contents of a new file will automatically delete all the previously existing data.

## Architecture

TBD
